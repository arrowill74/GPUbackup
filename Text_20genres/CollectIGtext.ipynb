      "Watched Alita Battle Angel on Dolby Cinema 3D at AMC for the Early 3D Fan Event, and it was down right epic! Now I'm not one for movies in 3D, but this film is one to behold on a premium format 3D showing if you can make it. Unlike most 3D movies, my eyes weren't affected by the typical visual and motion effects that give me headaches when a 3D movie's visuals get overwhelming. Action sequences were great. The fight scenes and the in-universe game \"Motorball\" really bring you into the film making you cheer and pump your fist in support of our heroes. I've been a fan of Alita since I first saw the anime and read some of the manga in the 90s and have waited a really long time for a live-action version to be made, but I am so glad they waited 'til technology was advanced enough for Battle Angel Alita to be brought to life. It really shows how much they love and appreciate Yukito Kishiro's stories. Well, I'll be seeing it again tomorrow, but this film is so good I just might see it at least three more times. #AlitaBattleAngel #Alita #RosaSalazar #ChristophWaltz #JenniferConnelly #MahershalaAli #BattleAngelAlita  #YukitoKishiro #RobertRodriguez #JamesCameron #JonLandau #DuaLipa #SwanSong #Cyberpunk #AMCTheaters #DolbyCinema #DolbyCinema3DatAMC #AlitaBattleAngel3DFanEvent #AlitaFunkoKeychain #runonsentences #sentencefragments #LoopinsMovieReviews #SemiRandomActsofLoopin\n",

Ultimately, with the help of Justin Brooks and the California Innocence Project, Banks’ conviction is overturned in 2012, his name is cleared, and he is finally free to pursue his NFL dreams. \n",

We came back to LA in FAST 7, and it was an especially emotional homecoming for those who’ve grown up with each other since that first shoot. \n",

      "I find Serenity to be a thrilling, ambitious, violent, spiritual, erotic, charged, dark, damning, contradictory, maddening, lushly intelligent film from the brilliant mind of Steven Knight.\n",
      "It asks a lot of the audience. It exists outside cut-and-dry, black-and-white moralizing, beyond the realm of “thumbs up” and “thumbs down,” “it sucked,” “it was bad-ass,” etc. It will need some analysis and conversation after. Good.\n",
      "Serenity is a sexy, surreal, modern noir for grown ups who are into things that don’t come standard. If that sounds like you, I hope you’ll consider giving us your time and attention.\n",
      "Thanks for listening xx\n",
