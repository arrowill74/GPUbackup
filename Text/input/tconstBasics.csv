But today, its grandeur has also become ubiquitous with the ravages of terrorism and counter terrorism operations. Under these circumstances, anyone roaming these hills would tell you the shocking truth: that combat soldiers are statistically safer than women. The calm melody of the idyllic villages is disrupted by the abrasive sputter of semi-automatic gunfire. In one such neighborhood, we see Aasma, a delicate young girl. For Aasma, heaven and hell are about to collide. The leader of the local village conceals four armed militants from across the border, in his house. In due course they notice the young girl. Mesmerized by her delicate beauty and overcome by lust, they kidnap Aasma. Their leader reasons that on their way to a suicidal terrorist attack, this is probably their last opportunity to be with a woman before martyrdom. As Aasmaa's night of torment unfolds, one of the militants, Intekhaab, shows signs of regret; he knows that Islam does not permit cruelty on woman. But in the presence of armed hostility he must find clever ways to delay the inevitable.

Great Britain stands alone in Europe against the growing stain of the rampant Nazi empire, its nervous inhabitants wondering what the future holds. But a handful of people on this beleaguered island know only too well what one possible future might hold. They have seen Warsaw burn, Poland crumble, France capitulate. Men like Jan Zumbach, Witold Urbanowicz, Miroslaw Feric and Tolo Lokuciewski, pilots of the Polish Air Force, who know that if the Luftwaffe isn't stopped, then Poland, Holland and France were just Hitler's hors d'oeuvres.

Now, though, the Poles have a fresh enemy - themselves, as nerves and fatigue take a terrible toll on men pushed to the limit by constant aerial warfare, fighting to save their own country above a foreign land.

For which reason, '101' has been produced on the basis of a silent structure. The film deals with the Battle of Tannenberg, which was fought in 1914 in East Prussia. It ended in victory for the Germans over the Russian armed forces. The commander-in-chief of the German army, Paul von Hindenburg, would go down in history as the 'victor of Tannenberg' because the German command decided to name the battle after the village of Tannenberg, which was located close to where the fighting actually took place. In this way, the Germans were trying to debunk the history of a defeat they had suffered in the first Battle of Tannenberg more than 500 years earlier in 1410. '101' is also concerned with today's world, which is shown from the perspective of the same protagonists playing the historic roles in the film. Theire viewpoints in the form of documentary tableaus are immersed in the main plot of the film in accordance with a subjective musical narration, as is characteristic for a silent film. '101' is an artistic view of the world today in a specific historic context, one which raises the question of whether, 101 years after the outbreak of World War I, it even makes sense anymore to shoot a further anti-ware film? And whether it is even worthwhile today to revere the film 'J'accuse!' which has sunk almost into oblivion.""101"" is in reverence to Abel Gance's film ""J'accuse!"" which is regarded as one of the most important anti-war films in history.

Set in the bubble gum pop world of Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan and told a la VH1's Behind The Music, Junie's story tops itself one scandal after another as she rockets to international stardom and then faces the aftermath of a life under scrutiny.

The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for the African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with The Negro Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.New York City bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga is searching for new employment after his nightclub is closed for renovations, eventually landing an interview as a driver for ""Doc"" Don Shirley, a famed pianist. Their first encounter does not go well, as Tony's flippant, uncultured behavior clashes with Don's sophisticated, reserved demeanor. However, Don eventually hires Tony on the strength of others' word, as he needs someone who can help him stay out of trouble during an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South. They embark with plans to return home on Christmas Eve. Tony is given a copy of the Green Book by Don's record studio: a guide for black travelers to find safe havens throughout the segregated South. They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading further south. Tony and Don clash over their differences, as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act properly, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. Regardless, Tony finds himself impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and increasingly disgusted by the discriminatory treatment the latter receives by the hosts when he is not on stage. After a bar incident leads to a group of white men threatening Don's life, Tony rescues him by threatening to pull a gun on them. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour.Dr Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighbourhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.In early-1960s openly and legally segregated America, two polar opposites--the distinguished and refined African-American classical pianist, Don Shirley, and the uncultivated Italian-American nightclub bouncer, Tony Vallelonga--are about to form an unlikely friendship. With New York's Copacabana Club being renovated, Don and his new problem-solver chauffeur embark on a lengthy two-month concert tour through the hostile Deep South, equipped only with a subtly tremendous talent, a serenely resilient dignity, and a little vert guide book for visitors--The Negro Motorist Green-Book. Before endless kilometres of unfriendly territory, a single man chooses the hard way for the sake of progress; however, can one person make a difference?October, 1962. Italian-American Bronx native Tony Vallelonga - long called Tony Lip by those that know him for being able to BS his way out of anything - largely uses that ability to BS, his street smarts and his fists to do his job in ""customer relations"" (i.e. a glorified bouncer) at the Copa, where he has to deal with well dressed toughs and thugs, albeit with a smile and often without they knowing that he is screwing them. Like most of his Italian-American friends and family, he is a working class bigot, as demonstrated by his actions concerning some black laborers who did work in his and his wife Dolores' apartment. With the Copa closed for renovations until the new year, Tony has to find another job in the interim, he, without telling Dolores, pawning some of his valuables in the meantime to put food on their and their two adolescent sons' table. When he is given the inside scoop on a job working for Dr. Don Shirley, he only did not know before meeting Dr. Shirley that the Dr. refers to his multiple Ph.D.s, and that he is a classically trained pianist (the head of the popular music playing Don Shirley Trio) instead of a physician, but arguably most importantly that he is a well educated, wealthy and refined black man. The job is not only as chauffeur as Tony initially thought, but to be his all-expenses and well paid general foot soldier, especially in the area of security, for the eight week tour he has arranged for the trio with his record label, much of that tour in the Deep South (the last scheduled date being December 23rd in Birmingham, Alabama) hence the need for especially that security in he being black. Renegotiating the terms, learning that Dr. Shirley actually recruited him based on his reputation for being able to get the job done, and getting the okay from Dolores in the stipulation that he make it home for Christmas or else, Tony accepts the job. Beyond the obvious hazards of the race relations aspect of the job once they get to the Deep South, they will not only have to get over their own differences as humans in their moral and ethical values to survive with each other for eight weeks, but deal with the general role reversal of the uneducated white man being subservient to the well-educated black man. In that aspect, Dr. Shirley may have other issues in the Deep South as not fitting into either the white or black populations in general.",Music,movie,Green Book,Green Book,0,2018,\N,130,"Biography,Comedy,Drama"

Together, they feel free and helpful. They will put all their energy into a discipline previously owned by women: synchronized swimming. So, yes it's a weird idea, but this challenge will allow them to find meaning in their lives...Middle aged Bertrand, suffering from debilitating depression, has not worked for two years, leaving his largely supportive but frustrated wife, Claire, to be the household breadwinner. Claire's support does not include standing up to her judgmental sister Clementine and her husband Thibault, with who they often spend time despite neither Bertrand or Claire much liking them and their superior moral attitude in their criticisms not only of Bertrand but about everything concerning their lives. On a whim, Bertrand decides to respond to a bulletin board posting at the local swimming pool to join a men's synchronized swimming team, to which he, after a short interview with the coach, former competitive synchronized swimmer Delphine, is accepted.

tt8991324,"'Lihaaf' ('The Quilt') is a 1942 Urdu short story written by Ismat Chughtai. Published in the Urdu literary journal Adab-i-Latif, it led to much controversy, uproar and an obscenity trial, where Ismat had to defend herself in the Lahore Court as well for this work. She was asked to apologize which she did not and also won the case, after her lawyer pointed out that the story makes no suggestion to a sexual act, and prosecution witnesses could not point out any obscene words, and the story is suggestive and told from perspective of a small girl. In the coming decades it was widely anthologised, and became one of her most known works, besides Angarey which remained banned for several decades. Years later, she mentioned in detail the court trial in her noted memoir, Kaghazi Hai Pairahan (A Life in Words: Memoir).Though it received attention for its suggestion of lesbianism, it also deals with the insulated and suffocating life of a neglected wife in the feudal society. It became a landmark for its early depiction of sex, still a taboo in modern Indian literature, let alone Urdu literature.

The story of Sinatra as never told before and Ava Gardner, the woman who saved him, by breaking him. Based on true stories.The steel line of sex and tension is palpable throughout this harrowing and heart-stirring Hollywood romance between Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. It's 1949 and Sinatra, the former king of swoon who once enchanted millions of ""bobby soxers"", is at the downturn of his career as the once golden ""Voice"" is now compromised by a hemorrhage to his vocal cords while his reputation is lambasted by the press who parade his alleged Mafia connections, liberal sympathies, and extramarital affairs. In the midst of his despair, he falls hard and fast for Gardner, MGM's sultry starlet with whom he shares proclivities for passion, whiskey, obstinacy, and sexual infidelities. Equal to his desire to maintain the interest of the mercurial Gardner, is his almost sacred infatuation aimed at attaining the role of Private Angelo Maggio in Columbia Picture's From Here to Eternity, the sole ray of hope in salvaging his career. An acknowledged long shot due to his questionable acting chops and heretofore box office bombs, Sinatra actively campaigns for the role while divorcing his wife, Nancy, and entering a sexually charged, but suspicion-filled marriage with Gardner that is marked by infidelities, Ava's abortions and Frank's suicide attempts as their hapless romance is parodied by the press who play them off each other. Acclaimed director, Michael Oblowitz, impeccably stylized the film, using locations in Rome, Italy, Hollywood, CA and Sinatra's Palm Springs home to bring Frank and Ava to life.

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl's generous holiday spirit. Funny, heartwarming, and visually stunning, it's a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism. Academy Award® nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company. With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Whoville when he runs out of food. Each year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter, and louder celebrations. When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas. To do so, he decides to pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh. Meanwhile, down in Whoville, Cindy-Lou Who, a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer, plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother. As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch's more nefarious one. Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus? Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos' holiday cheer once and for all?

tt6266538,"The story of Dick Cheney, an unassuming bureaucratic Washington insider, who quietly wielded immense power as Vice President to George W. Bush, reshaping the country and the globe in ways that we still feel today.Governor George W. Bush of Texas picks Dick Cheney, the CEO of Halliburton Co, to be his Republican running mate in the 2000 presidential election. No stranger to politics, Cheney's impressive resume includes stints as White House chief of staff, House Minority Whip and defense secretary. When Bush wins by a narrow margin, Cheney begins to use his newfound power to help reshape the country and the world.From being a Yale University dropout doing odd jobs in early-1960s Wyoming, Dick Cheney decides to take back control of his life, after his sweetheart and future wife Lynne Cheney's urgent ultimatum. As an intern during Richard Nixon's administration, Cheney grabs the opportunity to join the staff of his mentor, Donald Rumsfeld, who takes him under his wing, paving the way to rise through the ranks of the White House. After losing his job during Jimmy Carter's presidency, Cheney reluctantly accepts George W. Bush's proposal to be his running mate--a decision that would grant him the power to pull the strings of foreign policy, especially after the fateful and devastating 9/11 terrorist attacks.The political life of Dick Cheney, culminating with his Vice-presidency in the George W. Bush administration from 2000 to 2008, is presented, that political life largely supported by his equally ambitious wife, Lynne Cheney. Their political ambitions were generally hindered by his less than charismatic demeanor which most politicians require to succeed. Those politics drifted into the right side of the spectrum rather than moving to the right by a deliberately ideological choice. But being elected the sole House representative from their home state of Wyoming under the Republican banner led to ultimate thoughts of the top job in the White House. A number of factors kiboshed those thoughts, including how to protect his daughter Mary Cheney, who had just come out as lesbian, from public scrutiny while reconciling his support for Mary against the strong social conservative base of the Republican Party. The Cheneys' political fortunes changed when Dick, in the private sector as CEO of Halliburton, was asked by relatively inexperienced W. Bush to be his running mate. In this process, Dick began a manipulation of the system to his benefit where in his position of eventual VP he was able to be a more powerful politician working quietly and clandestinely behind the scenes than if he was actual president in the continual spotlight.",Biography,movie,Vice,Vice,0,2018,\N,132,"Biography,Comedy,Drama"

Director Bianca Charamsa made her way to Japan during this year's cherry blossom season to get to grips with the country's character through conversations with some of its artists. Among those she met were the actress Kaori Momoi, superstar architect Tadao Ando, Cannes award-winning director Naomi Kawase, and other cultural figures such as the artist Takahiro Iwasaki, writer Keiichiro Hirano and two guardians of traditional culture: a Soto Yen priest and a tea master. Although two violent atomic catastrophes - the bombing of Hiroshima and the Fukushima nuclear disaster - have shaken and shaped modern-day Japan, the artist Takahiro Iwasaki believes that memory of 6th and 9th August 1945 is slowly fading, despite all the folded cranes left by visitors to the memorial sites. Natural catastrophes like sea- and earthquakes also rock Japan time and time again; perhaps this explains why the Japanese aesthetic Wabi Sabi incorporates both beauty and decay...much like the beauty of the cherry blossom as it withers during the annual festival of Hanami.",Documentary,movie,Empire of Mirrors,Empire of Mirrors,0,2018,\N,52,Documentary

In the search for an ensemble that allows one to become better acquainted with the three countries, one first comes across the Kremerata Baltica, which expressly unites the most talented young musicians from Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and builds bridges - both within the Baltic and beyond. The ensemble was founded in 1997 by Gidon Kremer, who wanted to pass on his many years of experience as a musician to the next generation of artists from his homeland. The film accompanies the musicians of the Kremerata, who in turn lead to composers, soloists, choirs, ensembles and instrumentalists of the three Baltic countries. With wit and charm, the musicians show similarities and differences of their musical culture as they travel by land and sea from major urban centers to the musical province, and they also portray the eventful history of the Baltic States. The result is a varied and entertaining picture of three small countries with an enormous musical potential.",Documentary,movie,When the Evening and the Morning Meet - A Journey into the Music of the Baltic,When the Evening and the Morning Meet - A Journey into the Music of the Baltic,0,2018,\N,54,"Documentary,Music"

It interweaves the familiar story and stock characters of the genre with the theatrical and anarchic mode of Surrealism for which Bock has become known. The story unfolds in a gloomy, nocturnal realm - an indistinct conflation of reality and dream - centering on an unnamed town. Against a backdrop of simultaneous industrialization and grinding poverty, Bock tells the story of a stranger (played by Bibiana Beglau) who arrives in town pursued by mysterious guilt. She is accompanied by a young deaf girl, who emerges gradually as a powerful force - telepathically controlling the course of the story. A conflict develops between two other characters - the local priest (Ulrich Matthes) and a diabolical, dandified villain (Lars Eidinger) who plays with Death in the style of a medieval demon. Each character is revealed to be burdened by a different kind of guilt - stemming variously from the loss of a child, the loss of morality, and the loss of religion.",Western,movie,Hells Bells,Hells Bells,0,2017,\N,90,Western

tt6217608,"After suffering a near fatal head injury, a young cowboy undertakes a search for new identity and what it means to be a man in the heartland of America.Brady Blackburn, a rodeo bronc rider with some renown, learned everything he knows about horses and riding from his parents, Wayne and the now deceased Mari Blackburn. Brady is recovering from a fall off a bronking horse in a rodeo, the most serious of the injuries being a skull fracture which required a metal plate being inserted into his head. Including checking himself out of the hospital earlier than advised, Brady is determined to get back up onto the literal and proverbial horse as quickly as possible as being a cowboy is all he knows. But deep in his heart he knows that returning to the rodeo in particular is something that is probably not in the cards without increased risks, which is eventually confirmed by his doctor who tells him that he cannot sustain another serious head injury without some major consequence. He does not even want his friends and family to treat him with kid gloves in being able to do any of those physical activities which are part and parcel for him of being a man and a cowboy. Brady has to come to some realization as to this fact and come to terms with it - which is difficult even as his best friend, former rodeo rider Lane Scott will forever be institutionalized needing around the clock medical care from a similar accident - or end up killing himself physically in the attempt to bronc again, or killing himself emotionally in not being able to do what he loves.Brady lives in poverty with his father Wayne and his younger sister Lilly, who has autism. Once a rising star in the rodeo circuit, Brady suffered brain damage from an accident at a bronc riding competition, hindering motor functions in his right hand and leaving him prone to seizures. Doctors have told him he can no longer ride, or else his seizures will get worse. Brady regularly visits his friend Lane, who lives in a care facility after suffering severe brain damage from a similar bull-riding accident. Meanwhile, his dad does little to take care of the family, wasting their money away on drinking and gambling. To help keep their trailer, he sells away their horse, Gus, much to Brady's infuriating. Brady, in return, gets a job as a store clerk to help try to raise money for the family..",Western,movie,The Rider,The Rider,0,2017,\N,104,"Drama,Western"
