      "Watched Alita Battle Angel on Dolby Cinema 3D at AMC for the Early 3D Fan Event, and it was down right epic! Now I'm not one for movies in 3D, but this film is one to behold on a premium format 3D showing if you can make it. Unlike most 3D movies, my eyes weren't affected by the typical visual and motion effects that give me headaches when a 3D movie's visuals get overwhelming. Action sequences were great. The fight scenes and the in-universe game \"Motorball\" really bring you into the film making you cheer and pump your fist in support of our heroes. I've been a fan of Alita since I first saw the anime and read some of the manga in the 90s and have waited a really long time for a live-action version to be made, but I am so glad they waited 'til technology was advanced enough for Battle Angel Alita to be brought to life. It really shows how much they love and appreciate Yukito Kishiro's stories. Well, I'll be seeing it again tomorrow, but this film is so good I just might see it at least three more times. #AlitaBattleAngel #Alita #RosaSalazar #ChristophWaltz #JenniferConnelly #MahershalaAli #BattleAngelAlita  #YukitoKishiro #RobertRodriguez #JamesCameron #JonLandau #DuaLipa #SwanSong #Cyberpunk #AMCTheaters #DolbyCinema #DolbyCinema3DatAMC #AlitaBattleAngel3DFanEvent #AlitaFunkoKeychain #runonsentences #sentencefragments #LoopinsMovieReviews #SemiRandomActsofLoopin\n",

      "RG @annehathaway | Matthew and I are learning our film Serenity isn‚Äôt easily broken down into sound bites. I really like movies like that, but just in case I am in the minority, here are some reasons why I think you should see it:\n",
      "I find Serenity to be a thrilling, ambitious, violent, spiritual, erotic, charged, dark, damning, contradictory, maddening, lushly intelligent film from the brilliant mind of Steven Knight.\n",
      "It asks a lot of the audience. It exists outside cut-and-dry, black-and-white moralizing, beyond the realm of ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù and ‚Äúthumbs down,‚Äù ‚Äúit sucked,‚Äù ‚Äúit was bad-ass,‚Äù etc. It will need some analysis and conversation after. Good.\n",
      "Serenity is a sexy, surreal, modern noir for grown ups who are into things that don‚Äôt come standard. If that sounds like you, I hope you‚Äôll consider giving us your time and attention.\n",
      "Thanks for listening xx\n",

      "Regram from @thenyff: Edward Norton‚Äôs MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN is the Closing Night selection of the 57th #NYFF, making its New York premiere at Alice Tully Hall this Friday, October 11, 2019! In an unusually bold adaptation, writer-director @edwardnortonofficial has transplanted the main character of Jonathan Lethem‚Äôs best-selling novel Motherless Brooklyn from modern Brooklyn into an entirely new, richly woven neo-noir narrative, re-set in 1950s New York. Emotionally shattered by a botched job, Lionel Essrog (Norton), a lonely private detective with Tourette syndrome, finds himself drawn into a multilayered conspiracy that expands to encompass the city‚Äôs ever-growing racial divide and the devious personal and political machinations of a Robert Moses‚Äìlike master builder, played by Alec Baldwin. Featuring a rigorously controlled star turn by Norton and outstanding additional supporting performances by Bruce Willis, Willem Dafoe, @gugumbatharaw, @bobby_cannavale, @lesliemann, and Cherry Jones, plus a haunting soundtrack (featuring a score by Daniel Pemberton, with orchestration by Wynton Marsalis, and an original song by @thomyorke), Motherless Brooklyn is is the kind of production Hollywood almost never makes anymore, and a complexly conceived, robust evocation of a bygone era of New York that speaks to our present moment. #MotherlessBrooklyn #EdwardNorton #JonathanLethem #AlecBaldwin #BruceWillis #WillemDafoe #GuguMbathaRaw #MichaelKWilliams #BobbyCannavale #LeslieMann #CherryJones #ThomYorke #WyntonMarsalis\n",

      "This is an ad for @jayandsilentbobstash we did back in '97/98, when the Internet was still kinda new. At the time we created this, I felt more accomplished than I did when I made #clerks - because this was a picture of me and my friend on the back of a bona fide comic book, advertising our own bona fide comic book store in #RedBank #NewJersey. This was before I ever wrote a comic book too - so at the time, I thought that was the closest I'd ever come to being involved with the wonderful world of comics at all. But by the next year, I would write #Daredevil for @marvel and a @jayandsilentbob comic for @onipress - and a year or two after that, I'd do #GreenArrow at @dccomics. Decades later, we've had 5 seasons of a TV show called #comicbookmen set at the same comic book store featured in this ad. Now I've even directed an episode of @cwtheflash - but in the late 90's, this #secretstash ad was as close to my dream of being involved in the world of comics as I could get. Patience and diligence, kids: if you're patient and keep trying, you can seriously make your dreams come true. But it all starts with at least trying.

      "#Repost @thatkevinsmith SNOOGANS! Here‚Äôs a first look at @jayandsilentbobreboot, courtesy of our genius @dpronlevy and our master stills artist @kylebonokaplan. On this adventure, Silent Bob‚Äôs dressed pretty much the same as he‚Äôs been in #Dogma through #clerks2, but Jay‚Äôs outfit has changed a bit, including his Ranger Danger t-shirt designed by @captain_ribman (the artist who created my Fat Man logo). Years back when I was working on Clerks III, Ribman and I came up with a slew of Ranger Danger comic covers to flesh out the world of the flick and make it seem like Ranger Danger had been around as long as Superman and the Fantastic Four. When Clerks III went away, the artwork sat dormant on my laptop for years. But when Reboot started taking serious shape, I blew the dust off the Ranger Danger artwork and put it to work all over Brodie‚Äôs Secret Stash. But I saved the Dark Knight-ish Ranger Danger: Requiem shirt for Jay to wear throughout the flick because in the world of our movie, Ranger Danger: Requiem is a gritty, rebooted version of a childhood superhero fave. Today marks the end of Week One of filming, and what a wonderful week it‚Äôs been! We‚Äôve already shot a fist fulla cameos and @JayMewes is CRUSHING his return to the role that made him famous! If you‚Äôre way into this shit like I am, we‚Äôve kicked off a making-of series on my @youtube channel (like we did for Clerks II back in 2006) called ‚ÄúThe Road to Reboot‚Äù! See it at the link in my bio. #KevinSmith #jaymewes #movie #jayandsilentbobreboot #nola #sabanfilms #neworleans #wwambassador\n",

You got to be many people while you lived, so now rest forever as the only person that #snape #metatron #sheriffofnottingham and #hansgruber ever had in common: they were all brought to life by one of the greatest actors who ever lived. I will mourn you for the rest of my days, until it's my time to go.

      "#Repost @thatkevinsmith One year ago today, I almost died. So today, I‚Äôm living it up on with @jaymewes and Jason Lee on Day 1 of my new flick @jayandsilentbob Reboot! Thanks to @saban_films and Universal for the loot to make this epic, @jordanmonsanto and @destrofilms for making it happen, @jenschwalbach and @harleyquinnsmith for humoring my goofy bullshit one more time, and #jasonmewes for standing beside me all these years while I do the hardest thing I can personally ever do, either in film or in real life: simply shut the fuck up. I couldn‚Äôt think of a better scene with which to start the shoot than the return to the Mall with Brodie Bruce. The three of us gathered for a couple hours last night to run the lines and realized we first rehearsed together waaaaay back in the mid-90‚Äôs. It may be 24 years later and we may have 6 kids between us, but Jay, Lee and me partied like it was 1995, giggling while adding jokes and finding inflections. The Oscars were on in the background during our practice and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel relief when the ‚ÄúIn Memoriam‚Äù montage ended and I wasn‚Äôt in it. We picked 2/25 as the Reboot start date *intentionally*, to celebrate the fact that I did not become Silent Bob forever 365 days ago. But after a blissful couple hours of making pretend with my friends on the set of my 14th film, I‚Äôm starting to think I *did* die in that operating room after all. Because what could be more Heavenly than this? #KevinSmith #jayandsilentbob #jayandsilentbobreboot #jasonlee #jaymewes #neworleans #brodiebruce #wwambassador #movie\n",

      "#Repost This is the wrap gift t-shirt I gave to all the @supergirlcw cast and crew members who made my episode. Now having worked on both #Supergirl and @cwtheflash, I can equate the experience to making both a sfx extravaganza AND an indie flick at the same time: you have the talent and tools of a big budget movie but the time of a low budget flick. Most of the folks who work on these shows COME from feature films and do work you'd normally see in feature films - but do it in only 8 days. So it feels natural to celebrate the end of our journey the same way we wrap movies: with a free, commemorative t-shirt! Drawn by the always amazing @jeffquigley, we crib the most iconic Supergirl image in comics history: #superman holding his fallen cousin on the cover of #crisisoninfiniteearths. But standing in for the #manofsteel is the Man of Shhhh himself, #silentbob. Hopefully, this image isn't a prognosticator of my episode somehow killing the show I love. If there's any bad about #supergirllives, it's entirely mine: because the cast and crew made a fantastic episode. I know this not only because I was there watching when they did it, but also because I've already peeped some of the scenes our editor Barbara cut together. This thank you t-shirt is the least I can do for the folks who made me look like I might be good at my job. #KevinSmith #supergirlseason2 #jeffquigley #vancouver\n",

In the flick, we‚Äôve got a convention scene that requires lots of @jayandsilentbob themed extras! So I‚Äôm inviting you to join us AS those extras! I‚Äôm looking for all sorts #jayandsilentbob cosplayers of every gender, race or nationality, as well as creative variations of Jay & Bob too: like steampunk Jay & Bob, Jedi Jay & Bob, Rick & Morty Jay & Bob, Bat-Jay & Bob, Ape Jay & Bob, Zombie Jay & Bob, Furry Jay & Bob, etc! The funnier or the more fucked-up (within reason and without harming yourself or others), the likelier you‚Äôll get featured in our shots! If you ever wanted to get screen time in one of my dopey flicks, there won‚Äôt be a better chance than this! We shoot in and around the great city of #neworleans from 2/25 until the end of March, with the Con scenes scheduled toward the back half of the production. If you wanna share the silver screen with me & @jaymewes & many way more famous folks than us, email the #caballerocasting folks ASAP!

      "#Repost This is not a drill! This is an actual image from my laptop! Yes, Kids - @jayandsilentbob are coming back! Here's the story: Sadly, Clerks III can't happen (one of our four leads opted out of the flick). So I worked on a #Mallrats movie instead... which also didn't happen because it turned into a #Mallrats series. I've pitched said sequel series to 6 different networks only to find no takers thus far. Mind you, I'm not complaining: nobody gets to make EVERYTHING they wanna make in this business (do they?). And I've been lucky to make anything at all, there's so much competition out there, so many much cooler ideas from fresh folks. And besides: I had #comicbookmen and then @tuskthemovie and @yogahosers (which all came together so crazy quickly), and the podcasts and #fatmanonbatman. With all of that, how could I bitch about no Clerks III or Mallrats 2? Then when I started directing @thecw shows, it was such a slice of Heaven on Earth, I happily put my Askewniverse sequels to the side. Since I sold #Clerks and #Mallrats years ago, they're owned by others, which limits my moves with my own material. I don't mind: back in the day, all I ever wanted to do was sell my stuff so I could be in the movie biz in the first place. So I don't own Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy or #Dogma... But I DO own #jayandsilentbob. So while I love playing with someone else's new toys on @cwtheflash and @Supergirl, I'm getting eager to play with my old toys again in the inter-connected View Askewniverse I spent the first half of my career creating. And so all last month, I had the time of my life laughing while writing \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" - a fun flick in which the Jersey boys have to go back to Hollywood to stop a brand new reboot of the old \"Bluntman & Chronic Movie\" they hated so much. It's a tongue-in-cheek, silly-ass satire that pokes fun at the movie business's recent re-do obsession, featuring an all-star cast of cameos and familiar faces! And I already met with the good folks at Miramax and they're into it, so I'm hoping we'll be shooting in the summer! Never give up, kids. You CAN do anything you want in life, so long as you're patient and malleable. #KevinSmith\n",

I've been making merchandise for my flicks since 1996. I realized early on that I was never going to be George Lucas... but I could do Bizarro versions of the extracurricular stuff Jorge did when he wasn't making movies.

      "#Repost In 1997, @jaymewes, @jasonlee & I posed for a photo outside of the then-brand new @jayandsilentbobstash. That means this picture is now 20 years old. It was taken in the first few months of the Stash being open (the neon \"Noonch\" sign was a gift from #joeyadams). We spent 2 years at the Monmouth Street location before moving up to Broad Street in #redbank where we've been ever since. @samosier hand painted the window, which I saved when we moved. It now hangs behind the counter at #jayandsilentbobssecretstash. I'm proud of everything I've done in my career (yes, even @tuskthemovie & @yogahosers), but being a small business owner has always been my not so secret passion. It stands to reason that I love retail: I did make #clerks after all... #KevinSmith #jaymewes #jasonmewes #jasonlee #comicbookstore #comics #comicbookmen #newjersey\n",

      "#Repost The Princess stole my heart at age 7. Anybody who knows me knows #CarrieFisher was my first love. I thrilled to the adventures of #princessleia in the @starwars movies, but from '77 to '84, I was in love with Carrie Fisher herself. My bedroom was filled with Carrie Fisher pictures from any movie she was ever in (including Polaroids I took off the TV when #thebluesbrothers hit cable). I was jealous of Paul Simon when he was dating Carrie Fisher and wouldn't listen to his music until they split up. I paid to see Carrie Fisher and #chevychase in Under the Rainbow nine times when it was in theaters (mostly because Carrie Fisher was in underwear in one scene). In childhood, I committed myself to Carrie Fisher without ever meeting her the way novice Nuns commit themselves to Christ without meeting Him. Decades later, I got to tell her this when Carrie Fisher and @jaymewes were in a station wagon on the set of #jayandsilentbobstrikeback. She was gracious about hearing it for the zillionth time from the zillionth man or woman who grew up idolizing her, but wickedly added \"I'm glad to know I helped you find your light saber.\" And with that, she stopped being Carrie Fisher to me and just became Cartie. That's the Carrie I'll always remember: the dutiful standard-bearer of childhood dreams with a the wicked sense of humor and a way with words. She didn't want to get paid for her role in @jayandsilentbob Strike Back; instead, she asked that we buy her these antique beaver chairs. Her reason: \"Beaver seems an appropriate currency for this movie.\" When she was a guest on Season 1 of our @hulu show #Spoilers, Carrie curled up in the throne like she belonged there. And she did: after all, she was royalty. As a boy, I dreamed of marrying Carrie Fisher. As a young filmmaker, I dreamed of casting Carrie Fisher. As an adult, I dreamed of being as sharp-witted and prepossessed as Carrie Fisher. And now that Carrie Fisher is gone, I'll dream of my friend Carrie - whose entire magnificent career I was lucky enough to witness, whose honesty made me a better person, and whose spirit - like The Force - will be with us always. Goodnight, Sweet Princess...\n",

If there had never been stoner comedy flicks starring #cheechandchong, there would never have been stoner comedy flicks starring @jayandsilentbob! So to honor the pioneer who laid the tracks upon which our train runs, I cast #tommychong as Alfred, the Butler to Bluntman and Chronic in #JayAndSilentBobReboot! Watching Chong burn one in the movie and punctuate each thought with an iconic ‚Äúman‚Äù was beyond surreal for a longtime admirer such as myself. But I did *not* expect the great Canadian behind #chongschoice would also deliver the funniest ad-libbed line in the movie - one that still makes me laugh whenever I watch Reboot. #cheechandchong broke new ground in cinema, and I stole a bit of their shtick for my own flicks. So to give a nod in my ‚ÄúNext Movie‚Äù to one of my stoner film forefathers who is ‚ÄúStill Smokin‚Äô‚Äù was like having one of my ‚ÄúNice Dreams‚Äù come true!

      "#Repost @thatkevinsmith This is not a @redbox ad - this is a big thank you from @jayandsilentbob Reboot to the good folks at Red Box for the Gretzky-like assist in getting us a kiosk for our movie. I Tweeted at #redbox in pre-production, asking if they could help us out and the Red Boxketeers delivered! As with all the good things in my life, this movie starts at Quick Stop. And as in the real world, video stores (like Jay and Silent Bob themselves) are a thing of the past. So to help tell our story of how time marches on and how the past gives way (reluctantly) to the inevitable future, having the modern version of a video store Clerk make a wordless cameo at the top of the flick really sets the tone. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: we‚Äôre making a vulgar l‚Äôil comedy. But since the vulgar l‚Äôil comedian behind the camera nearly dropped dead last year, there‚Äôs a surprising amount of introspection for a #jayandsilentbob flick. I know this because I spent all weekend editing, cutting together 23 minutes of the movie, including the opening and closing scenes. The first scene is easily one of the funniest sequences I‚Äôve ever shot, and the final scene is heartbreakingly beautiful for a movie about cartoonish weed dealers who go on the journey of a lifetime. Again. We start Week 2 in 10 minutes. \n",

      "The music of #Prince was essentially the soundtrack to my life. My first girlfriend introduced me to his work, so any teenage heavy petting session was scored by the lusty purple pipes of his Royal Badness. #1999 and #PurpleRain were some of the first albums I ever bought. In 1989, his #Batman soundtrack never left my rack system. When we made #Clerks in 1993, the Love Symbol album was on a constant loop in my car's cassette player. @samosier & I were almost killed on the Turnpike in the pouring rain when our car momentarily slid under an 18-wheeler as we were funking out to 'My Name Is Prince' (we sang only 'The Morning Papers' for the rest of the way home). My wife & I flew to Minnesota for the Rave Un2 the Y2K concert at #PaisleyPark at the turn of the century, solely as fans. Less than a year later, I'd meet and work with the icon himself when I returned to Paisley Park to shoot a documentary with Prince during his Rainbow Children album listening party. I was lucky to have spent any time with him at all but I was far luckier just simply being alive in the Prince era. His music moved me, his lyrics captured my imagination, his journey from musical Minnesotan to worldwide superstar inspired me. I honestly thought I'd die before Prince - so it's sad to think there will be no new music in which he could sing us his point-of-view on the rest of his unique and legendary life. But having spent time at Paisley Park with the prolific Prince, I know there's a vault full of unreleased tracks we've still yet to hear. I told a long story about my week-long experience of working with Prince on the first Evening with Kevin Smith DVD - a story that would go on to help solidify my reputation outside of filmmaking as a raconteur. So as much as I got from Prince as a fan of good music, he also helped to shape ol' Silent Bob's second career as a talker. I cried today because I realized what a role model Prince always was to me: an Artist with a capital A who was not afraid to bite the hand that fed, never hesitated to reinvent himself, and was always entertaining on any stage. Today we lost one of the greatest Artists who ever lived\n",

      "#Repost Makin' Records in Red Bank! On Saturday, to celebrate the 20th birthday of our store @jayandsilentbobstash (and my 47th birthday), we organized the largest gathering of @jayandsilentbob cosplayers ever assembled in an attempt to make it into the @guinnessworldrecords Book! Before we had cable TV or the Internet, the imaginations of kids the world over were fired up by the #guinness Book. I'd spend hours flipping through the pages of obscure honors & rural records, dreaming of doing anything with my life noteworthy enough to earn my fat ass a place in the #guinnessbookofworldrecords one day. On August 5th, that day finally arrived! And as if that wasn't enough of an accolade, the Mayor of Red Bank Pasquale Menna gave me the key to the city, declaring it Kevin Smith Day! And all of this happened mere blocks from the hospital where I was born 47 years before. It was an unforgettable day that we captured on cameras for @comicbookmenamc, so if you weren't able to make it, you can see it when the show returns for Season 7 this Fall on @amc_tv!

Now I get to use that to help create characters for film, which is an incredible job. I actually started cutting hair at about 15 or 16 years old. My cousin Eric ( E-Rocc ) cut hair and he was so cool. Everybody loved him, people would come to his house all through the week and wait until it was their turn to get a haircut. He was putting designs in people‚Äôs hair. Every time he cut my hair I got so much feedback and people said I stayed fresh. I could always draw a bit so I decided to get myself some clippers just like Eric. I cut my older brother and best friend plus a few others very consistently. I‚Äôve always been a person who talked a lot so between practice and personality it just kept growing.‚Äù @jove14 (pc: @jgnstills ) @justmercyfilm\n",

      "Repost @time | For Michael B. Jordan, it‚Äôs easier to inhabit a role than to talk about it, writes @kararbrown. But there‚Äôs a lot to discuss when it comes to his next film, #JustMercy, an adaptation of Bryan Stevenson‚Äôs best-selling memoir, in which he stars as the activist lawyer. Just Mercy premieres at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday before hitting theaters this December in the thick of awards season. The film is a continuation of themes that @michaelbjordan has worked with before: humanizing the misunderstood, and shining a spotlight on inequality. It‚Äôs why Stevenson trusted Jordan with his story. ‚ÄúFilms don‚Äôt always carry the message of a book in an authentic way, and that was my anxiety,‚Äù Stevenson says. ‚ÄúBut I felt like he was sensitive to more challenging stories of life in America.‚Äù Jordan is hoping there‚Äôs an impact that reaches far beyond the film‚Äôs box-office take. ‚ÄúI want people to feel angry, upset, passionate, sad, inspired and optimistic,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthat you can make a difference.‚Äù Read more at the link @time bio.

      "Lawyer Bryan Stevenson‚Äôs career took an unusual direction after a judge asked him not to take on the case of Walter McMillian, a man wrongly accused of murder. Known by dozens of witnesses to be innocent, McMillian was initially sent pre-trial to Alabama‚Äôs Death Row without even a conviction. Seeking to challenge the biases he‚Äôd witnessed against the poor and minorities, and to empower the wrongfully convicted, Stevenson didn‚Äôt listen to the judge -- and took the case on. JUST MERCY, based on Stevenson‚Äôs memoir, depicts his fight for justice in an incredible true story of determination and hope. Today, he runs the Equal Justice Initiative (@eji_org) and has freed 100+ people from unjust convictions. \n",

      "\n",
      "I can recall the exact moment when that desire \"this is how I want to impact lives\" happened. It was when I saw the famous \"Jumpin Jive\" clip with Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers. I remember after watching this clip, literally three times straight, a deep passion came over me so strong it made me rethink my whole path in life. For me, I knew right then and there what I wanted to do. So much so, that I changed my major in college to Theatre. It was the first time in my life I really felt alive with purpose. I knew it was a moment in time I would never forget.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm a firm believer in \"faith without works is dead.\" So I began putting the work behind my faith which soon lead me to LA, embarking on a longevity career in dance, allowing me to make a healthy transition into acting. Which led me to audition for the feature film \"High Strung\".\n",

      "How would you describe your experience with the film \"High Strung\" Directed by Michael Damian?\n",
      "_______________________________\n",
      "\n",
      "I would describe my experience dancing in this film as challenging and fulfilling. This is the first time I have worked with choreographer, Dave Scott, who is also one of the main reasons I started on this journey of dance. I grew up trying to imitate his style. So for me, it was a fulfilling milestone experience, as well as challenging because Dave's choreography doesn't just fit on you, you have to push yourself & concentrate at it for it to even remotely look decent on you. I have done other movies but this is the first major film role for me.\n",

      "@vicki_the_asian started dancing when she was 5 at @icondancecomplexnj where she had #BethHubela for jazz. She stopped dancing for about 3 years to pursue soccer but then she came back when she was 8 to #JeffCowans @getemjeff 's  hip hop class. She got into company, and now she dances close to 13 hours a week. She won a full scholarship at the #BeIconicSummerCamp during the summer of 2013. When She got onto the @jrknightsdance team of #Rutgers, she knew that she was really serious about dance. Her heart was opened to dance by her grandfather. When Vicki was younger they would  dance together and he always tell her that she should dance. So she started dancing, and without his support and all of her mentors, Vicki wouldn't be where she is today. Thank you to @hiphopgeo #GeoHubela & @thepulseontour #PulseFam Who opened your heart to dance? #openheart Who is your #dancemom #dancedad #dance #inspiration ?

      "\"If a child told me they wanted to be a dancer, I would tell them to make sure they really love it and want it.  This is absolutely necessary!  The second is to not get wrapped up in the negativity that so often surrounds you. To block out criticism and stay away from gossip. Keep your personal integrity! Put your head down, work harder than you thought possible, and have a clear vision of the dancer you want to become. Everyone has a opinion, and everyone gives it, and everyone finds ways to tell you what you should being doing differently... If you listen to everyone, you'll no longer be yourself. You'll end up frustrated and confused.\" - Keenan Kampa, formerly with Mariinsky Ballet \n",

However, Jane sustained an injury that ended her dancing career & she then turned her sights to acting. Years later Jane would dance on @dancingabc .

      "Sarah Ashley Hunt is a dedicated and hardworking 10 year old dancer, actress, & model from Pittsburgh, PA. Sarah started dancing recreationally at the age of 5, but her parents soon realized that Sarah's abilities were far greater and her training needed to become top priority if her future in dance was to be a success. So, Sarah began dancing @ALDCStudioPGH under the strict instruction of world renowned choreographer and dance instructor Miss Abby Lee Miller @TheRealAbbyLee and Miss Gianna Martello @GMartello22 when she was 7! \n",
      "Presently, Sarah trains for over 30 hours each week focusing on all genres of dance, acro/gymnastics, and aerial silks, but her favorite style of dance is ballet! Sarah aspires to one day be a Broadway ballerina; therefore, privately trains en Pointe for over 4 hours each week! \n",
      "Some of Sarah's greatest accomplishments to date include: Guest starring on the hit television show @DanceMoms in seasons 4, 5, and 6 on @LifetimeTV; Performing alongside the South Shore Symphony Orchestra at the Madison Theatre in NY as the lead role of Clara in the @leggzltddance production of the Nutcracker; and most recently being chosen as the overall top winning model/ambassador for @DetailsDancewear.\n",

      "Just facetime this wonderful lady. Betty has always loved dancing and it is actually how her and her husband met over 60 years ago. They first met at a juke joint dance hall during WWII. Betty went with her friends and he went with his. He was too intimidated to ask her on a date because she was such a good dancer so he left and they didn‚Äôt see each other again. He enlisted into the Army and during his tour, he taught himself how to dance. After serving for 5 years, surviving Korea, and traveling 150,000 miles around the world, he returned to his home town and found Betty at the same dance hall and asked her to dance. She was hesitant because she knew he couldn‚Äôt dance. To her amazement, he not only could, but he was the best dance partner she ever had. The rest is history.\n",

      "@mattygoogs started dancing to music videos on TV with his Dad and enjoyed it so much. He began taking hip hop at @icondancecomplexnj at 3 years old with #GeoHubela @hiphopgeo He had his first show at the end of the season and was hooked once he got on stage. Matty took as many open classes as he could over the summer just so he could learn more choreo. ICON Instagram page posted his photo and called him a #4yroldprodigy. His parents set up a dance studio in their basement where Matty practices and tries to create his own moves. Matty would like to thank @hiphopgeo and so many of the big kids (especially @mikayla_lynn2001 @tmoneymiceli @jericholopez @lildougiedude @justin_g_226) that are so nice to him and help him get better. He is only 5 years old now and the future awaits. His heart is opened do dance #openheart ! Who is your #dancemom #dancedad #dance #inspiration ? Who opened your heart to dance?

      "Angelica started dancing at 4, and Arianna at 3. Their inspiration came from their father during his struggle with cancer. During his illness and after his death, Angelica and Arianna were motivated to keep doing what they love, because of his determination and his support of their dance endeavors. They both train at @icondancecomplexnj where they have been studying for 6 years,in all styles of dance for a combined 15 hours per week. Last year they became members of the Rutgers @jrknightsdance team where they have performed at football and basketball games including at Madison Square Garden. This summer, along with their #jrknightsdance team, they were extras in #highstrungmovie. They also starred in #ImperiaMusicGroup 's latest music video which featured their singing and dancing. In their down time, they can be found taking dance class and recording music. #JeffCowans @getemjeff @highstrungmovie #openheart Who opened your heart to dance?

      "From Greta ‚ù§Ô∏è: ‚ÄúI am brimming with happiness‚Äîthank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you (that‚Äôs six!) to the Academy. This film of Little Women has been over thirty years in the making, from the very first time Louisa May Alcott and Jo March reached across time and space and made me believe I could be a writer and creator. Every single person who worked on this film poured their heart and soul into it, and we are all so grateful to the Academy for recognizing the collective effort. I am so personally proud of each person who worked on the film, and I am bursting with joy for all of them. I have to say a few names loudly, because I am just so deeply thrilled for them‚Äîmy filming partner/wizard/genius Saoirse Ronan, you are my inspiration and my honesty and my co-captain, always, my baby girl superstar Florence Pugh, the Marmee of our dreams Laura Dern (woot! Marriage Story!!), our gorgeously talented and ridiculously intelligent Emma Watson, the bright shining soul and life force Eliza Scanlen, our Queen Meryl, and the fifth March sister and all around prince Timothee Chalamet. The men who, as Louisa says, make ‚Äúchivalry worth having,‚Äù Chris Cooper, Tracy Letts, James Norton, Bob Odenkirk, and Louis Garrel The costumes of Jacqueline Durran, the sets of Jess Gonchor, and the music of Alexandre Desplat‚Äîthey gave me such incredible gifts and each frame of the movie is filled with their skill and work and care. Amy Pascal, I have no words big enough but you know what is in my heart. Everyone at Sony and Columbia Pictures, especially to Tom Rothman, my favorite sparring partner and tireless champion. Writing and directing this film was an honor and sharing it with audiences has been the most sincerely heart-warming journey. I hope our Little Women does for another generation of girls and women what it did for me: lights a fire to write your book, make your movie, sing your verse. From all of us Little Women and Men, thank you to the Academy.‚Äù // #FemaleFilmmakerFriday | Regram from @emmawatson\n",
